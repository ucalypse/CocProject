<h2>TownHall 7</h2>

        <p>Town Hall 7 is where the game really starts to open up.  You remember that big lumbering barbarian looking thing that you have been starting
            to see in other bases right?  Time to get one of your own</p>

<h3>Farming Strategy</h3>
<div class="container">
    <div class="jumbotron">
        <p>I typically use 20 giants, 2 healers, 15 goblins, and 67 archers in my farming squad.  It is a heavy elixir army I know, but it will work well
            to get some of that sweet sweet dark elixir that is so hard to come by at town hall 7.  As far as spells go, I go in with 2 healing spells and 1 rage</p>
        <p>What you want to do is take a second and look at the base, if the clan castle is positioned as such that you think you can eye ball a lure, DO IT.  Nothing 
            is worse than seeing a weak ass base, with tons of loot, that you rush into only to have your entire squad of giants demolished by a few castle wizards.
            I have been playing this game for like 3 years and I cannot tell you how many people I have seen who entirely ignore castle troops as if they are not part of the 
            game. 
        </p>
        <p>With this particular farming strategy, you drop your giants at the same time and in the same place, and follow them up with 2 healers.  Any base you go up against will only
            have 3 air defense, so you have 2 options about where to begin your attack.  </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Start by an outer air defense, and send healers after you take it down</li>
            <li>Look and see how the 3 are positioned, and start away from all of them dropping your healers immediately</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You want to try and minimize your spell usage to keep your elixir usage low, just try and keep in mind that the spells make up almost half of the money
            spent on your army while raiding, so think well before dropping them.  If you only stand to gain 20,000 elixir by keeping your troops alive a little bit longer,
            it may not be worth it to drop that last healing spell, as you would barely break even on that</p>

        <h2>War Attack Strategies</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>20 Giants, 10 Wizards, 2 Healers, 32 Archers, CC Hogs(4)</li>
            <p>You will also possibly need 1 hog for troop draw depending on whether you can just use a giant to do it or not.  Basically, this is the last town hall that you can
                get away with using attacks so similar to farming attacks, and have it still work out in war.  Basically, it is a farming attack substituting wizards for a large majority of archers for more 
            firepower.  As usual, you must draw the cc troops out or your attack will most definitely fail.</p>
